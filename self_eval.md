# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

I'm definitely most proud of working my way through the entire assignment without allowing myself to get distracted.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

Primarily, methods prevent us from having to rewrite code over and over again. We can just call them whenever we need to repeat code.

Also, they are dynamic and can be fed different arguments to run code on different values, variables, etc.
